// select all relavant elements up here

// homepage needs at least 3 fetches...

// fetch function to post a new user to the database

// fetch function to create a new game in the database

// fetch function to add a user as player of a game
// this one should eventually redirect to '/play/:id' passing in the game id
// user will end up drawing in a room with the other players in the game

// need some button handling that considers the selected dropdown value
// disable the play button while creating a game is selected

// have event listeners on the dropdown input??
// this could handle updating the modal displays
